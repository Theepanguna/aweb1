          <p>	Google Class Room Plus Blackboard<br>
          Create the assessments based on learning outcomes for the modules delivered and those are approved by the relevant universities and external examiners.
          I utilise Google classroom and Blackboard to communicate with students and encourage them to actively participate in weekly quizzes. 
          Currently maintaining the overall quality and closely work with UK counterparts to run the program smoothly.

          	Canvas Platform <br>
          I have been facilitating course delivery of University of Technology Sydney via online learning modules since 2021 March and using the Canvas Platform to maintain the student interaction, releasing the learning resources and marking and moderating their assessments. <br>
          	Youtube Learning Resource<br>
          •	Developed a You-tube based learning materials for lab practicals and basic concept understanding and its developments.<br>
          •	Lecture Sessions are recorded and shared with the student for further discussion and reference <br><br>
           <h3>Class Room Contact Teaching</h3> <br>
          <p>The Delivery of the modules are divided into a number of small sessions. These include formal lecture, facilitating small group learning ,enhanced support for students with learning difficulties , demonstrations of experiments and interactive practicals.
          I would prefer the session to be lively rather broadcasting in a single tone. I encourage lots of creative ideas based on the subject and ask them to practice on their strength. I conduct workshops to enhance their skills in programming, hardware troubleshooting and other fun activities to engage with them.
          The friendlier approach always help them to reach me at the first point of contact and I could help them wherever possible.</p>
