    <h3> Research Portfolio </h3>
      
      <p> 
        My research interest has been centred around Hardware programming (Embedded and FPGA) to develop solutions, methods,
        processes and protocols by integrating Machine learning and Artificial intelligence. I am conversant with PIC microcontroller
        and Arduino based Platform and their related Programming software further, I have been working knowledge and experience in
        VHDL and Xilinx software Platform. Recently developed Teaching and/ or learning modules have been implemented in Spartan
        7 development board.</p> 
        Current research topics include:
        <p>‚Ä¢ Adaptive learning platform based on ROS for children with learning difficulties such as ADHD or Autism.</p>
        <p>‚Ä¢ Image processing based Electric Vehicle charging Robot ARM.</p>
        <p>‚Ä¢ Portable Vision aid device using Image processing</p>
        <h3>Master Research</h3>
        <h6>3D Tracking Capacitance Based ROS Controlled Robot Arm</h6>
        <p>√ò Synopsis</p>
      <p> This project addresses the design procedure of 3D tracking capacitance based ROS controlled Robot Arm. A Robot
        operating system (ROS) is used to model and control the robotic arm with 4 degree of freedom (DOF) to imitate the
        virtual (Simulation) to reality and Physical motion to reality without wearing any sensors at low cost.
        ROS is middleware upon which robotics system can be developed or constructed. The basic controlling operation can
        be categorized into two sections. Initial process begins with RVIZ simulator control wupied with Capacitive based 3D
        tracking mechanism was used to control the robotic arm and the simulator can be updated by detecting the hand gesture
        in the ùüèùüê √ó ùüèùüê √ó ùüèùüê ùêúùê¶ùüë cubic box range. Arduino Mega microcontroller development board is used as the
        interconnection between the Robot arm and the ROS platform. The communication was established via message and
        services (msg ans srv).</p>
      <p>√ò Discovery </p>
    <p>  ‚Ä¢ Developed and tested/ implemented successfully an algorithm to control 4DOF of Robot Arm effectively by using a
        capacity based hand gesture control.</p>
      <p> √ò Publication</p>
      <p>   ‚Ä¢ 3D Tracking Capacitance Based ROS controlled Robot Arm
        Presented at 26th Annual Technical Conference of IET Sri Lanka Network 2019. (ISSN: 2345-9558).</p>
        <h3>Undergraduate Research</h3>
        <h6>Development of a Computer Numerical Control (CNC) Drawing Machine</h6>
      <p> √ò Synopsis</p>
    <p> Developed a easy to understand learning module of a prototype computer numerical control (CNC) drawing machine.
        The module can be used to understand and analyse the performance and functionality related issues of CNC machines.
        This resulted in cost effectiveness and easily controlled by simple motor controllers. Stepper motors and controller
        circuits are employed to control the axes of the CNC machine. The real time CNC controller software (Kcam) is utilised
        to evaluate the system. The input file is created as G-code. The findings of this project can be used as base information
        in further development to realize a real world system that can be used in practice.</p>
      <p>√ò Discovery</p>
    <p> ‚Ä¢ Use of Low cost and Recyclable Materials to effectively learn the performance of CNC drawing machine.</p>
      <p> √ò Publication</p>
    <p> Development of a computer numerical control (CNC) drawing machine at present around the world 2013,
        organized by IET young professionals' section, Sri Lanka</p>
        
        <h3> Industry Research</h3>
        <h6>Ethernet Bootloader application for PIC microcontroller</h6>
       
      <p>√ò Synopsis </p>
    <p>This research mainly focused on programming a microcontroller remotely. I developed a Software (GUI) by using the
        Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) application in the visual studio along with Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP).
        This GUI is used to send the Hex code to program the client RFID reader (Micro controller) by using the Internet Boot
        loading through TCP/IP protocol. This finding help to update the reader¬¥s reading range remotely without visiting the
        place. </p>
      <p> √ò Discovery </p>
    <p>Developed a platform to remotely program a microcontroller to control the RFID reading range through ethernet
        bootlaoding </p>
